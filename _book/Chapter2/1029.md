### 二、题解

#### 解题思路

找到第一个出现了（n+1）/2次的数。a【i】表示i出现的次数

#### 参考程序

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int a[1000000];
int main()
{
    int n;
    int i,t,x,z;
    while(scanf("%d",&n)!=EOF)
    {
        memset(a,0,sizeof(a));
        t=(n+1)/2;
        for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            scanf("%d",&x);
            a[x]++;
            if(a[x]>=t)
            {
                z=x;
            }    
        }
        printf("%d\n",z);
    }
}
```
