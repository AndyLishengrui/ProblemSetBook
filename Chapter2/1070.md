### 一、题目

#### 问题描述

>Ignatius drinks milk everyday, now he is in the supermarket and he wants to choose a bottle of milk. There are many kinds of milk in the supermarket, so Ignatius wants to know which kind of milk is the cheapest.

>Here are some rules:
>1. Ignatius will never drink the milk which is produced 6 days ago or earlier. That means if the milk is produced 2005-1-1, Ignatius will never drink this bottle after 2005-1-6(inclusive).
>2. Ignatius drinks 200mL milk everyday.
>3. If the milk left in the bottle is less than 200mL, Ignatius will throw it away.
>4. All the milk in the supermarket is just produced today.

>Note that Ignatius only wants to buy one bottle of milk, so if the volumn of a bottle is smaller than 200mL, you should ignore it.
>Given some information of milk, your task is to tell Ignatius which milk is the cheapest.

#### 输入数据

>The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input is a single integer T which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
>Each test case starts with a single integer N(1<=N<=100) which is the number of kinds of milk. Then N lines follow, each line contains a string S(the length will at most 100 characters) which indicate the brand of milk, then two integers for the brand: P(Yuan) which is the price of a bottle, V(mL) which is the volume of a bottle.

#### 输出数据

>For each test case, you should output the brand of the milk which is the cheapest. If there are more than one cheapest brand, you should output the one which has the largest volume.

### 二、题解

#### 解题思路

>贪心思想求解。注意以下几点：
>1、如果某个厂商的体积小于200，直接略过它，不放进排序数组里
>2、如果某个厂商的体积超过1000，那么先把体积保存下，一旦超过，无论多大都只喝5天，所以b变为5，
>然后计算下权值（每天单价）a /  b 。 3、权值从小到大排序，如果权值相同，把体积从大到小排序
>(描述里要求的)。

#### 参考程序

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
    int t,n,i,v,v1,x;
    double p,min;
    char name[101],name1[101];
    scanf("%d",&t);
    while(t--)
    {
        scanf("%d",&n);
        min=100000000;
        for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            memset(name,0,sizeof(name));
            scanf("%s%lf%d",name,&p,&v);
            x=v/200;
            if(v<200)
                continue;
            else if(v>1000)
                x=5;
            p=p/x;
            if(p<min)
            {
                memset(name1,0,sizeof(name1));
                strcpy(name1,name);
                v1=v;
                min=p;
            }
            else if(p==min)
            {
                if(v>v1)
                {
                    memset(name1,0,sizeof(name1));
                    strcpy(name1,name);
                    v1=v;
                }
            }

        }
        printf("%s\n",name1);
    }

    return 0;
}
